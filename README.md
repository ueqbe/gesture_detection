Gesture Detection using LSTM Model
This repository contains an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model designed for gesture detection. The model takes as input both images and videos, aiming to detect frames within a video sequence that match a specific input image. The output of the model indicates whether each frame in the video matches the input image, with the result being "detected" or "not detected."

How it Works
Input Image: The model requires an input image that serves as the reference for detecting similar frames within a video sequence.
Input Video: The input video is processed frame by frame, with each frame being compared to the input image using the LSTM model.
Detection Process: The LSTM model analyzes the visual features of each frame in the video and compares them to the input image. If a frame closely matches the input image based on the learned patterns, the model outputs "detected" for that frame.
Output: The output of the model is a series of detections for each frame in the video, indicating whether it matches the input image or not.

Getting Started
To use the gesture detection LSTM model, follow these steps:
Clone the Repository: Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine.
Install Dependencies: Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can find the required packages in the requirements.txt file.
Prepare Data: Prepare your input image and video data. The input image should be the reference for detection, and the video should contain frames you want to analyze.
Run the Model: Run the LSTM model with your input data to perform gesture detection. You may need to adjust parameters or configurations based on your specific use case.
